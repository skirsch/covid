### The vaccine increased your risk of getting COVID
The COVID_infections file obtained by a FOIA request to the SCC PHD shows that **98%** of the people who were diagnosed with covid were vaccinated for COVID in January of 2022. This is problematic because at that time only **86% had been vaccinated**. So the vaccine likely made you more likely to get COVID. Specifically, On January 31, 2022, the county reported 265,032 unvaccinated residents and 1,592,306 vaccinated residents.
