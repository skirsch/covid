### The vaccine increased your risk of getting COVID
The COVID_infections file obtained by a FOIA request to teh SCC PHD shows that 98% of the people who were diagnosed with covid were vaccinated for COVID in January of 2022. This is problematic because at that time only 86% had been vaccinated. So the vaccine likely made you more likely to get COVID. Specifically, On January 31, 2022, the county reported 265,032 unvaccinated residents and 1,592,306 vaccinated residents.

### The CFR went up almost by a factor of 4X after the COVID shots rolled out! The PHD said NOTHING to warn the public about their serious mistake.
It's using their own data. 

Here's where you dowload the data:

1. [Covid deaths by date and facility type](https://data.sccgov.org/COVID-19/Count-of-deaths-with-COVID-19-by-date/tg4j-23y2/about_data)
2. [COVID-19 cases at Long Term Care Facilities by date](https://data.sccgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-cases-at-Long-Term-Care-Facilities-by-dat/ksyb-fnbm/data_preview) until May 5, 2021

Here is [the analysis of the data showing nearly a 4X increase in CFR IMMEDIATELY after the shots rolled out.](./CFR_LTCF.xlsx)
