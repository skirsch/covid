the obfuscation method randomizes data in each record

It is NOT reversible even if you knew the algorithm.

It keeps things such that mortality analysis is not impacted and shifts data minimally.

The full code is stored in a private bucket in my s3 server which I typically access via Cloudberry Explorer.

The private bucket is "confidential" with subdirectory "japan" This holds the original data and the obfuscation algorithm and python code that runs the obfuscation.
